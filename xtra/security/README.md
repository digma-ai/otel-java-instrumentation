### file secr-key-ring-file-gpg

following the guide of [OSSRH](https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg/)
we had to generate key using GPG software.
then we followed guide of [Gradle Signing Plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html)
and we exported our key to this pgp file and kept it locally.
